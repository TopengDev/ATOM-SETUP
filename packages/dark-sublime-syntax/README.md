# Dark Sublime Syntax Theme for Atom

An unholy mashup of [rubjo's Ultimate Dark Neo](https://github.com/rubjo/ultimate-dark-neo) and [odahcam's Atom Sublime Monokai Syntax](https://github.com/odahcam/atom-sublime-monokai-syntax) with additional inspiration from [sarunasdjacenko's Monokai Sublime](https://github.com/sarunasdjacenko/monokai-sublime) and a little bit of markdown support thrown in for good measure.

I tried about ten million different themes, and tried to figure out what it was I liked about each of them. And this was the result. It's a dark theme, but with less contrast so it's slightly easier on the eyes. Well, on my eyes at least. 

Best used with [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/).
